# gdFFMPEG

This is an FFMPEG implementation via GDNative.   
The implementation is semi-naive so not super optimal.  
  
Currently this project has only been tested for Windows and only the Windows binaries are provided here.  
The binaries for other platforms will have to be manually compiled.
  
It should work for any format the FFMPEG but I've not extensively tested it there are probably many cases of incompatibility not yet found.  
The most common error is bad audio playback under certain conditions.
